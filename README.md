# Saving-Alert

There's a growing need for blood in Sri Lanka due to more accidents and illnesses. But there aren't enough people donating blood, which creates problems for hospitals that need it. Especially with COVID-19, it's even harder to get blood because of restrictions.

To tackle this, we're creating an online blood donation application where people who want to donate blood can connect with hospitals that need it. It's like a matchmaking service for blood donors and recipients.

The proposed system utilizes a rule-based system to facilitate blood donor-hospital matching. When a blood donation request is received, the system evaluates factors such as blood type compatibility, proximity to the hospital, and donor availability.

In this project, we'll explain why this platform is important, examine what others have done, and detail how our system will work. So, let's dive in and see how we can save lives through blood donation.

**Aim**
This project aims to develop a user-friendly online platform that facilitates efficient blood donation and transfusion processes in Sri Lanka. By leveraging technology, the platform aims to bridge the gap between blood donors and hospitals in need, ultimately contributing to saving lives and improving healthcare accessibility
