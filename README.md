There's a growing need for blood in Sri Lanka due to more accidents and illnesses. But there aren't enough people donating blood, which creates problems for hospitals that need it. Especially with COVID-19, it's even harder to get blood because of restrictions.

To tackle this, we're creating an online blood donation application where people who want to donate blood can connect with hospitals that need it. It's like a matchmaking service for blood donors and recipients.

The proposed system utilizes a rule-based system to facilitate blood donor-hospital matching. When a blood donation request is received, the system evaluates factors such as blood type compatibility, proximity to the hospital, and donor availability.

In this project, we'll explain why this platform is important, examine what others have done, and detail how our system will work. So, let's dive in and see how we can save lives through blood donation.

**Aim**

This project aims to develop a user-friendly online platform that facilitates efficient blood donation and transfusion processes in Sri Lanka. By leveraging technology, the platform aims to bridge the gap between blood donors and hospitals in need, ultimately contributing to saving lives and improving healthcare accessibility

**Objectives**

- Create a secure and intuitive web application that allows individuals to register as blood donors and hospitals to request blood transfusions.
- Implement a robust backend system that stores donor and recipient information securely and facilitates real-time communication between donors and hospitals.
- Utilize the rule-based system to accurately match blood donors with nearby hospitals needing specific blood types.
- Conduct functional testing and validation to ensure the reliability, scalability, and usability of the platform across different devices and environments.


**Scope of the Project**

- The project focuses on developing a web-based application accessible to users across Sri Lanka, catering to both blood donors and hospitals (blood banks).
- The platform supports registration and authentication mechanisms for donors and hospitals, ensuring the security and privacy of user data.
- Donors can update their availability, blood type, and location, while hospitals can submit blood requests specifying the required blood type and quantity.
- The rule-based system is integrated into the application to facilitate efficient matching of donors with hospitals based on geographic proximity and blood type compatibility.
- Additional features such as donor tracking, notification systems, and user dashboards are included to enhance usability and functionality.
